The open source VSCode project, along with VSCodium[^1], completed their latest monthly release with v1.59[^2]. Let's take a look at some features that the insiders build[^3] had their impatient, bleeding-edge hands on (before we all forget what 1.59 brought before the upcoming August 2021 release).

## Share view state

VSCode users are often bouncing around different files in their workspaces. By default, if you close out a file tab, VSCode doesn't track where you were in that file. This can be annoying if you didn't mean to close out the file, or because you were playing whack-a-mole with the new workspace trust popups.

Say hello to shared view states across editor groups[^4]. Editor groups are the windows of tab collections within the VSCode editor[^5] that grow whenever **Split Editor/Open to the Side** commands are used. These groups can remember your past so that your rampant mind doesn't need to.

> Ah yes, that's right, I left off at the pig people.[^6]

## Terminal magic tricks

By default, a new terminal can be created with `Ctrl+Tilde(~)`, where it pops up in the bottom as an entryway into the powerful, dark underbelly of shells. VSCode 1.59 highlights some wizardry alternatives.

### Create terminals to the side

Are you one of those people that spins a monitor into portrait mode, because of some insatiable love for 90<sup>o</sup> angles? Maybe you simply prefer tall terminals? `Ctrl+Shift+P` and `Terminal: Create Terminal in Editor Area to the Side`[^7], will be exactly what you're looking for.

### Drag and drop terminals across windows

How many VSCode windows are sitting open on your desktop? Are you taking notes in one workspace, while continuing your commands in a separate VSCode window? Make your life easier, retain all your in-shell variables, and drag the active terminal from one window to another.

This can be helpful when improving the documentation in one window as active development is happening in another.

An excellent bonus: remember when typos were just typos? The worst thing that could happen was other people making fun of your lack of oxford comma's. Now, with terminal editors, your typo can shutdown your production database! Fun!

## Live preview

The _Live Preview_ extension[^8], originally released in June, has continued along. For users working in JavaScript land, **Live Preview: Show Debug Preview** ensures a built-in JavaScript debugger[^9].

Note that this extension has the warning:

> **WARNING: this is extension is still under development!**

For the brave javascripters among you all, who want the beautiful reflections of instant-progress within the editor, take it for a test drive. Report any issues to the [microsoft/vscode-livepreview](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-livepreview) repo.

## Other notables

> General tip: Wondering what shortcuts are configured in VSCode? One shortcut to rule them all: `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`
- Or `Ctrl+Shift+P` -> **Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts**

- If you're using an M1 Mac, you should get the latest VSCode 1.59.1[^10] point release, as it addresses a bug where VSCode may crash.
- A _preview feature_[^11] has been added for automatic language detection in unsaved/untitled files. `experimentalLanguageDetection`[^12] (search against settings via `Ctrl+Comma`) can be set to `true`, which uses an ML model from `yoeo/Guesslang`[^13] with the open-source ML library `TensorFlow.js`[^14]. VSCode is planning for this feature to be `true` by default in the future, so that code is recognized out-of-box, instead of always relying on the file extension or force **Change Language Mode** (`Ctrl+K M`).
