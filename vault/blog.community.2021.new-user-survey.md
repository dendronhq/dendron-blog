## What's Next

We've set aside the majority of this quarter, and the last, to iterate on the feedback you've given us (specific details to come in a future blog post).
We are committed to making Dendron the absolute best tool and community for thought in 2022 and beyond!

If you like to be part of the effort, please take part in the [2022 Dendron User Survey](https://link.dendron.so/74EI) and help us build a better tool for thought ðŸŒ±
