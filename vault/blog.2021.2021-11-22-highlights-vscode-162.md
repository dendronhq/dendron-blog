The open source VSCode project, along with VSCodium[^1], completed their latest monthly release with v1.62[^2]. For those of us that haven't been using the Insider's Build,[^3] it's time to look at what's new.

Make sure to checkout the [VSCode 1.62 Release Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKvtYHfzE3g) on YouTube!

## Liveshare

Many people are attracted to Google Docs due to how easy it is to collaborate, comment, and highlight sections in order to give each other scathing reviews. Introducing [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack): now, instead of waiting for the PR review, you can provide non-constructive feedback to your peers!

_Virtual Workspaces_[^4], such as [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/) and [github.dev](https://github.dev/), now support this superpower.

Take note: if you are a VSCodium user, this might not work! I learned this after spending too much time confused. Be aware of the [live-share license agreement](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare/license), including the information about data collection, which may be part of the incompatibility with VSCodium. There are alternatives, though, such as [CodeTogether](https://www.codetogether.com/).

## Bracket pairs

I enjoy whenever features lessen confusion for my eyeballs. I never bought a pair of Google Glass, even as men everywhere were accidentally taking photos while using urinals in pubic restrooms. [Bracket pair highlighting](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_62#_improved-bracket-pair-guides), though, to show where I am in the russian dolls of nested loops? Yes, please.

Settings of interest:
- `"editor.guides.bracketPairs": "active"`: Only show guides for **only the active** bracket pair.

- `"editor.guides.bracketPairs": "true"`: Show guides for **all** bracket pairs, with different colors.

## Verified publishers

When installing extensions, it's nice knowing you're installing the real deal. Microsoft could have gone the whimsically difficult route that Twitter has taken with their blue checkmarks, but instead they have made it an easy process. This was how I learned GitLens was acquired by GitKraken: [the truth is out there](https://www.gitkraken.com/blog/gitkraken-acquires-gitlens-for-visual-studio-code).

Found a duplicate extension? Check whether one is from a verified publisher by jumping into the Marketplace.

## Other notables

> General tip: Wondering what shortcuts are configured in VSCode? One shortcut to rule them all: `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`
- Or `Ctrl+Shift+P` -> **Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts**

- A [CVE was addressed](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_62#_unicode-directional-formatting-characters) involving characters that became invisible, leading to code that could compile differently than visually expected.
- Extension note: [GitHub PRs and Issues](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_62#_github-pull-requests-and-issues) brings issue and PR interaction directly into VSCode. Have you taken a look yet?
  - Latest updates can be seen in the [extension changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0320).
- Issues resolved in point releases, referred to as "Recovery" releases, can be found on GitHub: [`1.62.1`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22October+2021+Recovery%22+is%3Aclosed), [`1.62.2`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22October+2021+Recovery+2%22+is%3Aclosed), and [`1.62.3`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22October+2021+Recovery+3%22+is%3Aclosed).
