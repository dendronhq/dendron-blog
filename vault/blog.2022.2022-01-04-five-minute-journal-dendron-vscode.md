It's 2022 and you're looking to start off the year right by keeping a journal. Where to start? _The Five Minute Journal_ (5MJ)[^1] is a simple but effective way to get started with note taking.

## The Five Minute Journal

Tim Ferriss,[^2] world-famous entrepreneur and author of books such as _Tribe of Mentors_,[^3] uploaded a video in 2020 all about his approach to note taking with physical notebooks.[^4] 5MJ helps him express gratitude, make your days better, and focus on mindfulness.

In this post, we'll be going over how to create your own 5MJ using [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/). Dendron is a structured note taking tool for developers that is open source, local first, and integrated with Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## Prerequisites

This post expects that you've gone through the [Dendron Getting Started Guide](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1/) and have a workspace opened to work with. If you're new to Dendron, make sure to take a look.

## Concepts

### Daily journal notes

Daily journal notes are special notes meant to easily track your everyday life. Dendron also has a built-in [Calendar View](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/25287595-96bb-410b-ab46-eb9a26b0e259/#calendar-view) that helps you visually navigate and create new journal entries.

### Templates

Templates are notes with pre-outlined content meant for reuse. Templates can either be inserted into an open note with the `Dendron: Insert Note` command, or automatically applied at note creation with [Schemas](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052/). These are meant to reduce friction in the creation of new content, providing standardized outlines to your notes.

### Schemas

As you end up creating more notes, it can be hard to keep track of them all. This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes at scale. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your notes. They describe the hierarchy of your data and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.

## Steps

### Create 5MJ template

- Open [lookup](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html) (`Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L`)

- Type `templates.daily-5mj` in the text prompt and hit enter to create the template

- Copy and paste the following markdown:

```markdown

-->

## Morning

<!-- Fill out this section after waking up -->

### Gratitude

I am grateful for:

1.
2.
3.

### What would make today great?

1.
2.
3.

### Daily affirmations

I am...

## Evening

<!-- Fill out this section before going to sleep, reflecting on your day -->

### Amazing things that happened today

1.
2.
3.

### How could I have made today even better?

I could have made today better by
```

- Save the file.

You now have a new template with the 5MJ outline.

### Create 5MJ schema

> Templates can be used with or without schemas. Run [Insert Note](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47.html#insert-note) to insert a template into a currently opened note.

- Open [schema lookup](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/60c03500-98e4-4a02-a31e-2702b4068a88.html) (`Ctrl+Shift+L` / `Cmd+Shift+L`)
- Type `5mj` in the text prompt and hit enter to create the schema, which should look like the following:

```yml
version: 1
imports: []
schemas:
  - id: 5mj
    children: []
    title: 5mj
    parent: root

```

### Update 5MJ schema contents

We are going to use [Inline Schema](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#inline-schema-anatomy), a simpler schema format that takes less lines and uses indentation for visual understanding.

- Replace the content of `5mj.schema.yml` with the following:

```yml
version: 1
schemas:
# Daily is the top most schema since its parent is 'root' it must have an identifier
# this identifier 'daily' will be used when using 'Lookup (schema)' command.
- id: daily
  parent: root
  title: daily
  desc: ""
  # Children of the top most schema do not need to contain identifier and just 
  # require a 'pattern' to be set to match the hierarchy of notes.
  children:
    - pattern: journal
      children:
          # This pattern matches the YYYY (year) child hierarchy
        - pattern: "[0-2][0-9][0-9][0-9]"
          children:
              # This pattern matches the MM (month) child hierarchy
            - pattern: "[0-1][0-9]"
              children:
                  # This pattern matches the DD (day) child hierarchy
                - pattern: "[0-3][0-9]"
                  # As with regular schema we can set the template to be used with
                  # the match of our notes. Below is an example usage of shorthand template
                  # definition (which defaults to type: note). 
                  desc: Five Minute Journal
                  template: templates.daily-5mj
```

The `pattern` attribute is using a [Glob Pattern](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#glob-pattern), which is an expression used to match ranges and combinations of characters.

To match with the daily journal structure:

- Example: `daily.journal.2021.12.31`
- Patterns:
  - Year: `[0-2][0-9][0-9][0-9]` means match the range `0000 - 2999`
  - Month: `[0-1][0-9]` means match the range `00 - 19`
  - Day: `[0-3][0-9]` means match the range `00 - 39`

This means all new daily journal notes are within pattern ranges.

### Create a new daily journal

Creating a daily journal entry results in the `templates.daily-5mj` template automatically inserted.

- Run `Create Daily Journal Note` (`Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Shift+I`)

You should see a new daily journal note with the 5MJ template inserted.

## Congratulations!

### Key takeaways

After doing this, you've now:

- Created a 5MJ template
- Created a 5MJ schema
- Created your first daily journal with the 5MJ template applied via schema
